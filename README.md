This project is a simple movie application that uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern and the SwiftUI framework. MVVM is a popular architectural pattern for building iOS applications because it separates the user interface (UI) from the business logic, making the code easier to maintain and test. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework that makes it easy to create beautiful and interactive user interfaces.

The application uses the TheMovieDB API to fetch movie data. The API provides a RESTful interface to the movie database, making it easy to search for movies and get their details.

The application is built using the Xcode IDE. It is compatible with macOS 10.15 or later and Xcode 13 or later.
